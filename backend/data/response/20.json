{"response": "I can't believe this has happened again. Instead of all night, I did everything I could, and still I missed it. Do you know what that feels like to pour hours into something to hold your breath every second? And then watch the clock strike past the deadline. It's like the ground is slipping under me. My heart is racing, my hands can't stay still, and I keep replying every mistake in my head. Why did I move faster? Why did I start sooner? It's like shouting into a void. No one hears, and no one cares. I'm struck, stuck, picking up the pieces. Every sound around me, greats like static. Every second feels too loud, and I can't shake this restless crawling energy. I just want to break free of it, but it won't stop. It won't stop, and I can feel it pounding my chest louder, louder, louder."}
